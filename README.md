## Getting started

The provided [Configurator](https://spilymp.github.io/ibo/) can be used to quickly and easily create new appicons in the style of the
appicons of the ERP system [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/).

But it is also possible to use the included js class elsewhere and create your own configurator based on it, for example.

For this purpose, the class offers a few more parameters for individualization in addition to the options explained in the documentation section.

## Documentation

The basis of the configurator is a JavaScript class "IBO_ICON", which creates a canvas and "paints" the icon on it (see file [`/js/ibo_icon.js`](https://github.com/spilymp/iob/blob/main/js/ibo_icon.js)).
If the existing class is used directly by means of a script, additional parameters can be passed.
If this class is instantiated, various parameters can be passed to it.
If not, default values are used in each case.
